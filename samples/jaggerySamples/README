Samples : jaggery samples
===================

Introduction
============

Here is one simple sample that demonstrates the some functionality of the jaggery
deployed as jaggery applications in WSO2 Application Server .


Building the sample
========================

1. Use "ant" command in the wso2as/samples/jaggerySamples/ to deploy them.
2. This will copy directory in to the wso2as/webapps/ directory. If you start AppServer, those jaggery apps will be
available in the server.
